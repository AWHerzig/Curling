# So it's curling right
# 120 ft (distance is going to be feet) from shot to front of house.
# House is 12 feet deep and perfect circle.
# 20 ft across actually maybe it's 19, irl it's 16.5 i think
# Hog line at 105ft, T at 135 i think is where i put it even though i think technically is might be 132
# Players will have x-acc, y-acc, sweep, and *maybe* brains
# Teams have Leads, Seconds, Thirds and Skips
# Stones are assumed to be 1ft in diameter, irl it's 11in
